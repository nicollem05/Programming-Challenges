Programming Challenges (100 Points Total)
This repository contains solutions for various logic-based programming exercises, each focused on fundamental Java concepts such as loops, decision structures, and mathematical calculations.

Challenges and Objectives for each problem:
1.Test Scores and Grade: Prompts for five test scores, displays a letter grade for each based on a standard scale (A: 90-100, B: 80-89, etc.), and calculates the overall average. 
2.Race Results: Collects names and race times from three runners and displays them sorted by their finishing order. 
3.Quantity Discounts: Calculates the total purchase amount and discount for software packages priced at $99 based on a quantity-tiered discount table.
4.Bank Service Fees: Computes monthly bank fees by adding a $10 base fee to per-check charges that decrease as the number of checks written increases. 
5.Sorting Names: Takes three names as input and displays them in ascending alphabetical order.
6.Penny Salary: Simulates a salary starting at one penny and doubling daily over a specified period, displaying the results in dollars.
7.Budget Analysis: A budget tracking tool where users enter a monthly limit and various expenses to see if they are over or under budget. 
8.Random Number Guessing: A loop-driven game where the user guesses a secret random number with "Too high" or "Too low" feedback.
9.Dice Game: Simulates 10 rounds of dice rolls between the user and the computer, tracking wins to determine an overall grand winner.
10.Character Counter: Prompts the user for a string and a specific character to count how many times that character appears in the text.
